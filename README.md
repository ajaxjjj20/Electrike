# Electrike
This is the code for the senior project group, Electric Tandemonium at Cal Poly.  This is a prototype and is specific for the tricycle that we modified.

The library that we made is included in this github, but there are quite a few other libraries that this code needs.  They can be downloaded or easily found online.
