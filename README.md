# Electrike
This is the code for the senior project group, Electric Tandemonium at Cal Poly.  This is a prototype and is specific for the tricycle that we modified.

The library that we made is included in this github, but there are quite a few other libraries that this code needs.  They can be downloaded or easily found online.
The list of needed libraries:
<Keypad.h>     //Include keypad header
<LiquidCrystal.h>    //Include LCD header
<EEPROM.h>       //Include EEPROM header
"StopWatch.h"    //Include stopwatch header
"EEPROMAnything.h"  //Include EEPROM anything header
"SPI.h"
"LPD8806.h"
